# What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.
A tuple is an immutable sequence of elements. This means that the contents of a tuple cannot be changed once it is created. Tuples are typically used to store related pieces of information that are not meant to be changed.

Difference between List and Tuple
The main difference between a list and a tuple is that a list is mutable (can be changed) and a tuple is immutable (cannot be changed).

A list is created using square brackets 
[]
 and can contain any type of data (strings, integers, floats, etc).

A tuple is created using parentheses 
()
 and can also contain any type of data.

Tuples are faster than lists, so if we need to store data that you don't need to change, a tuple is the better choice.
