# How will you set the starting value in generating random numbers?

The starting value for generating random numbers can be set using the srand() function in C. This function takes an unsigned integer as an argument and uses it to seed the random numbe generator.

For example:

srand(time(NULL));

This will set the starting value to the current time.
