# How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python?

There are two basic types of functions available in Python: built-in functions and user-defined functions.

Built-in functions are functions that are pre-defined in Python and are always available. Examples of built-in functions include 
print(), len(), sum(), max(), min(), abs(), and round().

User-defined functions are functions that are defined by the user. These functions are created using the 
def keyword and can be used to perform specific tasks.
