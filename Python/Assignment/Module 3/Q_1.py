# Q_1. What is List? How will you reverse a list? 
A list is an ordered collection of items. In Python, lists are written with square brackets.

To reverse a list, we can use the reverse() method.

ex.
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

method 1:
reverse_list = list.reverse()

print(reverse_list) 

method 2:
print(list[::-1])
