# How will you randomizes the items of a list in place?

# we can randomize the items of a list in place using the shuffle method from the random module.

# Below is an example of how to do this:

import random

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
random.shuffle(list1)

print(list1)

# The output of the code above would be a randomised version of the list my_list.
