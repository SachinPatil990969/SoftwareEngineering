# Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python? 

Exception Handling:
- Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to deal with errors that occur during the execution of a program.
- It helps to gracefully handle unexpected situations and provides a way to recover from errors.

Key Concepts:
- Try: The `try` block is used to wrap the code that might raise an exception.
- Except: The `except` block is used to handle specific exceptions that might occur within the `try` block.
- Else: The `else` block is executed if no exceptions are raised in the `try` block.
- Finally: The `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.

Errors in Python:
- In Python, errors can be broadly classified into two main types:
  1. **Syntax Errors:** These occur during the parsing of code. They usually indicate a mistake in the code structure.
  2. **Exceptions:** These occur during the execution of the program, indicating an error or exceptional condition that needs to be handled.

Common Built-in Exception Classes:
- `TypeError`: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.
- `ValueError`: Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument with the correct type but an inappropriate value.
- `FileNotFoundError`: Raised when a file or directory is requested but cannot be found.
- `ZeroDivisionError`: Raised when division or modulo by zero takes place.
