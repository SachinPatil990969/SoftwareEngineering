# How many except statements can a try-except block have? Name Some built-in exception classes: 

In a `try-except` block, you can have multiple `except` statements to handle different types of exceptions. There is no strict limit on the number of `except` statements you can have, allowing you to handle various exceptions in a single `try` block.

Here are some common built-in exception classes in Python:
- `ValueError`: Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument with the correct type but an inappropriate value.
- `TypeError`: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type.
- `FileNotFoundError`: Raised when a file or directory is requested but cannot be found.
- `ZeroDivisionError`: Raised when division or modulo by zero takes place.
